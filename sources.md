### Images

The images of the organisms used in the visualization, are obtained from the GBIF metadata linking to [Observation.org](https://observation.org/), which is the "*... largest nature platform in the Netherlands and part of the Observation International Foundation ...*" (from "[Observation.org > About Us > Mission](https://observation.org/pages/mission/)"), and bear the copyright of their respective authors.

- *Note*: The image URLs in the GBIF metadata (*vide supra*) might not include all the images that exist in the actual full reports.

For those observations without an image in the GBIF metadata, I have used the Wikimedia Commons image from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:No_Image_Available.jpg (Col pr, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons)
