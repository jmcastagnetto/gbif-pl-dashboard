### About this visualization

This visualization shows observations of different organisms in Poland (taken from GBIF), localizing each occurrence in the map (with some metadata associated), and accompanied by a barchart indicating the number of individuals of a given species observed in a particular year.

You can search an organism by its scientific or common name, and also use a year range selection to filter the observations shown in the map.

Each marker in the map, gives a short summary of the observation, and provides a link to a more thorough report at Observation.org
